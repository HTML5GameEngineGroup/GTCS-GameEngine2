Problems with previous approach:
- weird dependency relationship (between Engine and Shader, between Core and VertexBuffer)
    - gl is treated as global, should be explicit
- unclear separation of responsibilities (between Shader and VertexBuffer)

How I solve them:
- use modules (now part of JS language, supported by all browsers except IE)
- engine is responsible for buffers, shaders is responsible for uniforms, shader configs.
    - this could probably change. Engine responsible for uniforms?

Higher-cost proposed changes:
- use webpack 
    - allow us to bundle in glsl, but adds build complexity
- we anyway might want to switch to npm to manage dependencies
    - i looked ahead. we have an external dependency for matrix math in next chapter

Other issues:
- XMLHTTPRequest is bad (solved by using webpack, or refactoring to fetch)
- MyGame should not be using "this". There's a better (easier) way to do singletons is JS
